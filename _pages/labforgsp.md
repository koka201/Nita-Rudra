The Lab for Globalization and Shared Prosperity is dedicated to fostering a deep understanding of the interplay of globalization, social investment, and inequality. We plan to do so through the American Dream Index, which analyzes a city's ability to leverage globalization to improve the standard of living for the median voter. With the American Dream Index, we will be able to gather information regarding the local policies, politics, and practices that ensure that the benefits of globalization are equitably distributed.  In tandem with the American Dream Index, the lab researches the relationship between globalization, labor, social investment, gender, race, and climate on national and local policy levels. Through our research and partnerships, we aim to facilitate meaningful conversations and propose actionable solutions regarding globalization to contribute to advancing a sustainable, just, and inclusive world.
